        <h1>How Will AI Affect Modern Day And Future Music?</h1>
    </div>
<!--<hr>-->
        <p>This Topic arose due to my love for music.I listen to music an absurd amount and recently more than ever due to my favorite artist releasing new music.
            And I began to think about how i will listen to music in the future, maybe my next favorite artisit might be an AI
            Sure nowadays some music already sound like an Ai created it
            But that is just some modern day music. Although future Music created by AI might be indistinguishable from Artist,
            There will still be the truth behind it and we will have to wait and see how the future unfolds</p>
