    <h1>How Will AI In Music Effect us in the Future?</h1>
  </div>

  <p>Our Future is for certain, there will be AI. What matters is how there will be AI, At the pace it is taking now, It will be all around us. Its on our phones, laptops, ears, glasses and even our brains.
    It is a very unique feelins that I get when talking abotu this, It is a bit worrying but also hopeful.</p>
    <p>It is a very useful tool and as ive heard before it is a "tool" that is what it should be used as and if we as humans are able to control it and maintina its abilites and limit it then we should be on a safe path.
    Sounds like im saying there will be an AI war but its capabilties as of now are incredible and soon it will haev sky rocketed in advancements. As for AI in Music I beleive music is a sacred place and should stay that way but there is no way of stopping people to use it in music, but it should be used a tool not as an artist.</p>
